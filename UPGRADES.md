## 0.2.0 — framed contract identity

This is a breaking wire change. Deploy every EthosZero peer with
`signal-ethos-zero` 0.2.0 in one coordinated rollout. New frames carry contract
identity 1 and wire revision 2 inside the rkyv envelope; 0.2.0 rejects frames with
the former revision or another contract identity before accepting their bodies.

Do not mix 0.1.0 and 0.2.0 peers on one socket. Drain or stop the old peer, deploy
the new peer and its pinned contract revision, then reopen the socket.
